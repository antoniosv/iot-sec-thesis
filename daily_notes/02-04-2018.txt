--------------------
Rendering the UI
-------------------

Servlets to render the Basic UI can be found on marthome/git/smarthome/extensions/ui/org.eclipse.smarthome.ui.basic/
The CmdServlet sends the commands to the event bus of the ESH.
WebAppServlet serves the html code based on the sitemap model.


Idea on authorization:
Check JWT token, if valid, grant access to the endpoint, i.e., to get or set data. The UI will still "work" even without authentication, but the data won't be there.


----------------------------
Implementing JWT into ESH
----------------------------

To make use of a 3rd party library into the code, it's enough to put the dependency in the pom.xml file. Then, in the source code, just put the import. For example, in pom.xml:

   <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.jsonwebtoken</groupId>
            <artifactId>jjwt</artifactId>
            <version>${version.jjwt}</version>
        </dependency>
   <dependencies>

And in the file, e.g. org.agoncal.sample.jaxrs.jwt.rest.UserEndPoint.java:
    import io.jsonwebtoken.Jwts;
    import io.jsonwebtoken.SignatureAlgorithm;

Then, any methods from the Jwts and SignatureAlgorithm classes may be used in the UserEndPoint class.
