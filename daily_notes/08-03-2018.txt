Jersey is a framework that implements JAX-RS, and it allows annotations to be used for a REST application in Java.
HTTP Basic Authentication checks each request and then allows or denies it, according to the credentials (username:password) provided. It also grants or prohibits access to resources according to that authentication. Login is done within the request (with a special HTTP header).

A class that parses the HTTP request to get username and password is needed. Starting from Jersey 2.x, the filter system runs in parallel of the resource code. This means that a resource will have access to a request before the user is added to the request, and thus authorization cannot be enforced. As an alternative, Jersey introduces the PreMatching annotation that means "must run before".
Example:
	@Provider
	@PreMatching
	public class AuthFilter implements ContainerRequestFilter {
	// showing relevant parts:
	   String auth = containerRequest.getHeaderString("authorization");
	   String[] lap = BasicAuth.decode(auth);
	   User authentificationResult =  AuthentificationThirdParty.authentification(lap[0], lap[1]);
		   

* Filters *

Basic Authentication Filter https://gist.github.com/neolitec/8953607
Main points:
     - BasicAuthenticationFilter implements Filter
     - @Overrides doFilter
     - HttpServletRequest object for HTTP header (incl. Authorization)
     - HttpServletResponse to output response.
     - If authentication fails, set response header to "WWW-Authenticate", "Basic realm="protected"", and error 401 with a message.
     - It does however not set up a login context (request.login(name, pass)).


* On Paper UI *
The web application, Paper UI, includes some module for authentication in:

    ./extensions/ui/org.eclipse.smarthome.ui.paper/node_modules/localtunnel/node_modules/request/lib/auth.js
