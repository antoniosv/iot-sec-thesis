Idea: create a filter in openhab2, and register it.
With it, catch the http request, and print it as log, as a starting point.
Later on, we can take it a level higher and enforce authentication for servlets and REST endpoints.

Hint: use http whiteboard pattern to register filter. It is supported by pax-web.

So: install pax-web bundles into openhab2 runtime first, and then register filter.

Packages that might be required:
  org.osgi.service.http.whiteboard
  org.osgi.service.http.context
