Some quick things to check when doing imports:

- Get the correct package name
- Include package name in MANIFEST.MF file
- In ESH particularly, don't put the dependency into the pom.xml
- Try to make a lib/ directory in the bundle, and then reference to it in the build.properties file also in the bundle as:
source.. = src/
output.. = target/classes/
bin.includes = META-INF/,\
               .,\
	       lib/nimbus-jose-jwt-5.8.jar,\
	       lib/jose4j-0.5.5.jar
- Also include the Bundle-Classpath field into the MANIFEST.MF
- Put the 3rd party library packages into Export-Package, not Import-Package, like:
Export-Package: org.jose4j.base64url;version="0.5.5",
 org.jose4j.jwt;version="0.5.5",
 org.jose4j.jwt.consumer;version="0.5.5",
 org.jose4j.keys;version="0.5.5"
From Lukasz:
you don't have to delcare dependency on lib via Import-Package directive in manifest, it is there for your module.
If you would like to expose nimus to other modules then you need to add Export-Package so other modules can use Import-Package
----
- Try to put jars into the esh/targetplatform/third-party/ to see if that helps
- In other osgi applications, there are two ways: let maven handle dependencies (put the info on pom.xml) on compile and runtime, or make the maven-apache plugin include the dependencies into the final jar (as in the org.dreamland.whitefilter application)
